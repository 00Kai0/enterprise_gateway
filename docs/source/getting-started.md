## Getting started

This document describes some of the basics of installing and configuring
Jupyter Kernel.

### Installation

See [the readme](https://github.com/jupyter-incubator/kernel_gateway/blob/master/README.md)
for help installing Jupyter Kernel Gateway.

### Try It

```bash
# install from pypi
pip install jupyter_kernel_gateway

# show all config options
jupyter kernelgateway --help-all

# run it with default options
jupyter kernelgateway
```

As an alternative to installing the kernel gateway from pypi, one can also
use the [minimal-kernel](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/minimal-kernel/) 
image from the [docker-stacks](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks)
project to try out its functionalities.
